                                    You freeze in your steps. The bear doesn’t seem to have heard you. 
                                    <br>
                                    Its rifling through some large bushes, before it leans down and sticks its head inside. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It looks like its eating something. There’s another faint rustling in the distance and the bear reels back, standing at full height. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It follows the rustling and leaves the area. You’re not sure when the bear will come back but it’s quiet again.

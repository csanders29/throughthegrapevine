                            Ignoring the darkness, you take a step forward.
                            <br>
                            You don’t fall through any holes, so you keep going. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The sunlight from the entrance can’t reach this far back into the cave, 
							so now you too are enveloped by the darkness. 
							<br>
							You can barely make out your own hand in front of your face.
                            <br>
							<br>
                            Its still very dark. You wave your hands in front of you, but you don’t feel 
							any obstacles in front of you. 
							<br>
                            <br>

                            You make your way through the crowd. You hear a passing conversation by the herb shop.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            “That’s way too expensive! I could go out and pick my own damn herbs for free!”
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            “You won’t be finding anything cheaper or as high quality as the herbs we have here, sir.”
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            “Ha! At this price?! <span id = "clue">Hiking up Mt. Mendi and finding the krysanteemi</span> would be more worth then paying this!”
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            “You know that’s just a myth! Our shop’s herbs may not<span id = "clue"> cure everything like the krysanteemi</span>, but they’re the next best thing!”

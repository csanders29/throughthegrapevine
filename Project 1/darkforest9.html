                                    You ignore the bush. You walk past the bush and continue on what you assume is the path. Just as you pass the bush, you hear more rustling behind you.

                                    <br>
                                    Turning around, you see...
                                    <br><br>a goat. It runs you out of the forest. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    You manage to escape the goat somehow. Youâ€™re back outside the woods.

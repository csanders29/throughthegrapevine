                        You slowly lower yourself into the boat.  You can hear it creaking as you settle in.
						<br>
						<br>
						The boat seems to hold up so you start to paddle outwards further into the water.
						<br>
						There is a nice breeze. The waters are calm waters and relaxing. 
						<br>
						You feel at ease.

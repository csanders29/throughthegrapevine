                                    Taking another look, you step closer, practically pressing your face to the leaves. 
                                    <br>
                                    You make out the faint outline of something clinging to the branches. 
                                    <br>
                                    
                                    You grab at it, only to reel back at the feeling of something exploding liquid on your fingers. 
                                    <br>
                                    Thereâ€™s something sweet smelling covering your hands.

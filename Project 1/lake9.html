                        You sneakily maneuver around the sleeping gator. 
						<br>
						It makes a small noise, but luckily doesn’t wake up. 
						<br>
						You keep paddling towards the center of the lake. 
						You see something in the distance floating towards you. 
						<br><br>
						You squint to try to make it out.
						<br>
						Hopefully it’s not another alligator.
						No, it seems much smaller…
						Maybe it’s some debris.
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						You paddle closer towards it.
						<br>
						You see what looks like... a lily pad? 
						<br>
						On top of it you can see what looks like a seashell.
						<br>
						The sun peeks through the sky and as the seashell reflects the light, you can see it shining all the colors of the rainbow.
						You pick it up off the lily pad and put it in your pocket.
						<br><br>
						You don’t see anything else on the lake.

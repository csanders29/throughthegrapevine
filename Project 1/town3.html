                            You weave through the gaps between the crowd as you pass a string of jewelry shops.
                            <br>
                            “Come on by ladies! We have the best jewelry this side of town!”

                            <br>
                            “No, no! We have the best jewelry! With excellent quality and cheaper then anyone else!”
                            <br>
                            “Our necklaces are decorated with only the best stones, just as luminescent as a diamond!”
                            <br>
                            “Well our necklaces use shells like the ioko and are just as luminescent as the ioko, if not more so! Definitely better than any old diamond!”

                            <br>
                            “Mom, I want that one!”

		                    “But sweetie, that one over there looks much better.”

                            “But the ioko is supposed to be good luck and good health! They say that <span id = "clue">real iokos used to be used for medicine! When you grind them up, they had healing properties</span>!”
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            “You know that that’s just a silly old wive’s tale! Iokos don’t exist any more!”

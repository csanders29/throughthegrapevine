                You, the player, have a sick mother and have been informed today that her condition has suddenly turned for the worse..
                The doctor says they have no medicine that can cure her illness, and that she’ll inevitably die soon, unless some miracle occurs.
                Faced with no available options, you decide to seek to make a legendary elixir that is rumored to be able to cure anything.
                You must scour the country and find the ingredients for the elixir to save your mom.
                The only problem is that you’re not even sure where or what those ingredients are. But never fear! Take advantage of the towns!
                Though it may just seem like useless prattle, every rumor has a source it must stem from. Use the townsfolk to learn about the elixir’s ingredients’
                locations and descriptions before it’s too late!

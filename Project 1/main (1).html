			You, the player, have a sick mother who will die soon, unless there's a miracle.  
			
			The doctor says there's no medicine that can cure her.
<br>			
			With no options, you seek to make a legendary elixir that is said to cure anything. 
			You must scour the country and find ingredients for the elixir.

                            You pass the cave entrance and keep moving forward.
                            <br>
                            The trail stretches on to the top of the mountain. 


                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The air gets thinner as you keep walking. The trail gets steeper and steeper.

                            <br>
							As you finally reach the top, you see nothing but dirt, rocks, and some sparse shrubbery. You hear a noise from behind you. 

                            <br>
							You turn around. Its a goat. It runs you off the mountain.
							<br><br>
							You’ve managed to escape the goat somehow. You’re back at the base of the mountain.
							<br>

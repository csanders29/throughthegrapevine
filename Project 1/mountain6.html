                            The entrance of the cave is nothing more than a dot behind you. You can’t see anything.
							<br>							
							You shuffle forward slowly. 
							<br><br>
							You kick up a few rocks but you haven’t fallen yet, so you keep going. 
							<br>
							<br>
                            You see a dot of light in the distance up ahead.
							<br>
							You turn around and you can’t see the entrance behind you anymore.
							<br>
							Maybe you’ve gone in circles?    
                            <br><br>
                            You walk forward towards the light.
                            <br><br>
                            You reach the light source, to find a flower, basking in the light filtering through 
							a crack in the ceiling of the cave. 
							
							You look around the place but there doesn’t seem 
							to be any other way to go except the way you came.

                                    You make your way into the forest carefully. The hum of crickets echoes in your ears. If you hadn’t known for a fact that it was still daylight out, you would have thought it was already late at night with how dark it was now. 
                                    <br> 
                                    Looking up, all you can see are densely packed branches above you. It feels as if something’s following you.

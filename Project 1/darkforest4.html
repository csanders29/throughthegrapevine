                                    You walk the overgrown path. It somehow gets darker. 
                                    <br>
                                    Bushes and branches scrape your legs and snag your clothes as you walk. It's become unnaturally quiet. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Before you can go any further, you hear a faint rustling coming from up ahead.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It's a large bear that almost blends into the darkness.

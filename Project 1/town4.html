                            The smell of baked bread floats through the air as you pass open bakery doors. The store is full of people browsing the baked goods.

                            “Oh these look good! Are they a new creation?”

                            “You always say that when you make something new!”

                            “Of course! <span id = "clue">Inanis berries are said to add years on your life</span>! I could use a couple more, you know! I’m getting old after all!”

                            “Its too bad, they say <span id = "clue">inanis berries only grow in Rima forest</span>! It’s almost as if that place is always night with how dark it is in there. It doesn’t help that <span id = "clue">inanis berries are just as dark</span>. You can’t see anything in there!"

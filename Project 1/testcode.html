                            You make your way through the crowd. You hear a passing conversation by the herb shop.
                            <br>
                            “That’s way too expensive! I could go out and pick my own damn herbs for free!”
                            <br>
                            “You won’t be finding anything cheaper or as high quality as the herbs we have here, sir.”
                            <br>
                            “Ha! At this price?! Hiking up Mt. Mendi and finding the krysanteemi would be more worth then paying this!”
                           <br>
                            “You know that’s just a myth! Our shop’s herbs may not cure everything like the krysanteemi, but they’re the next best thing!”

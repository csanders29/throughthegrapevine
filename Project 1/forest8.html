                                You try to shake the tree trunk. You grasp the trunk and give it a hard rattle and the tree sways with the movement. You can hear the leaves above you rustle. You look up, in time to see a few of the fruits come falling down. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                On your head.
                                <br> 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                You black out. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                You wake up after an unknown amount of time. You’re somehow outside of the forest. You’ve lost the fruit you had picked up first.

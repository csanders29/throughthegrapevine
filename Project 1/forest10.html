                                    Taking a few steps back, clear of the tree, you pull your arm back and launch the fruit you’d picked up at the tree leaves. 
                                    <br>
                                    Your aim could use work as you miss and undershoot, hitting the trunk just below the leaves. 
                                    <br>
                                    The fruits fall to the ground with dull thuds. You pick two up, to see they’ve left clear dents in the ground. 
                                    <br>
                                    You place them in your bag.
                                    <br>
